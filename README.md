# Description 
Minimizing the Riesz energy using some standard solvers. The code tries to find
a (local) minimum of an energy functional generated by a discrete subset of the
** d ** -dimensional unit sphere assuming the points of this subset interact via
the Riesz kernel: **|x1-x2|^-s**. 

The problem is controlled by a set of parameters specified in the _control.inp_
file:
- **s** is the power used in Riesz kernel
- **dim** dimension of the ambient space
- **file** is an int, controlling whether a starting configuration is provided; if
  not, a random one is generated
- **numpts** total number of points in the configuration
- **outfile** name of the output file; .txt extension will be appended
- **LBFGSHistorySize** previous iterations of the LBFGS-method that need to be taken into account


Written with [Ziqi (Ken) Yang](https://github.com/kenyangzq) with input from Doug
Hardin and his collaborators. Based on a [Cpp solver library](https://github.com/PatWie/CppNumericalSolvers)




The uppercase prefix shows the solver that's being used. Suffixes: _parallel
uses OMP, _truncated minimizes an energy produced by the truncated version of
the Riesz kernel.

ATTN: since commit **94e0ea4** only L-BFGS_truncated.cpp is used. This is to be
changed sometime soon.
